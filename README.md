## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Front-end Developer Junior** with a strong foundation in **UI/UX and design**, transitioning into software development with hands-on experience in **real-world projects**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **design and code**, building interfaces that are not only visually clear but also **performant, scalable, and user-focused**. I’ve worked on projects involving **SaaS platforms, dashboards, data visualization, and legacy system modernization**, always with attention to performance and usability.

I value **clean code**, **clear communication**, and **continuous learning**, and I thrive in collaborative environments where feedback and improvement are part of the process.
